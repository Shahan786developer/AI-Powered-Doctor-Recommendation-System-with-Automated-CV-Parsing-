This project proposes an AI-powered Doctor Recommendation System where patients can search for doctors using filters such as specialization and location. Doctors will upload their CVs, and the system automatically parses key information like qualifications, experience, and skills, storing them in a SQLite3 database. The AI evaluates the doctor's talent, skill level, and expertise based on the information extracted from the CV. The AI-generated recommendation provides a clear overview  for each doctor, making it easy for patients to choose the best doctor based on this Ai Feature. Patients can directly contact doctors through their profile, which includes email or phone details. Admin verification ensures all doctor profiles are legitimate. The system is designed to streamline the doctor-patient connection process by using AI to evaluate doctor qualifications efficiently and accurately.
